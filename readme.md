# Spring Boot Innovations

Welcome to the Spring Boot Innovations repository! This project is part of the "Apprentice to Architect" series, where we explore advanced Spring Boot concepts, focusing on custom annotations and Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) and other springboot concepts.


## Chapters

### Chapter 1: Introducing Custom Annotations - The Power of `@StringProcessor`

In Chapter 1, we dive into the `@StringProcessor` annotation, exploring its definition and usage. You'll learn how to apply various text processing rules to string fields, integrate it with DTOs and services, and use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to ensure consistent processing.

- **Source Code for Chapter 1**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/parthbt143/springboot-innovations/tree/main)

## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following packages:

- **Annotations**: `com.parthbt143.springboot.innovations.annotations`
    - `StringProcessor.java`: The custom annotation for string processing.

- **Aspects**: `com.parthbt143.springboot.innovations.aspects`
    - `StringProcessorAspect.java`: The aspect that processes fields annotated with `@StringProcessor`.

- **Controllers**: `com.parthbt143.springboot.innovations.controllers`
    - `StringProcessorController.java`: Demonstrates the annotation in action.

- **DTOs**: `com.parthbt143.springboot.innovations.DTOs`
    - `UserDTO.java`: Shows usage of the annotation within a data transfer object.

- **Services**: `com.parthbt143.springboot.innovations.services`
    - `StringProcessorService.java`: Processes `UserDTO` objects and prints the results.
