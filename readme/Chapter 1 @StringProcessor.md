# Chapter 1: Introducing Custom Annotations - The Power of `@StringProcessor` in Spring Boot

Welcome to Chapter 1 of the "Apprentice to Architect" series! In this chapter, we dive into the power of custom annotations in Spring Boot with a focus on the `@StringProcessor` annotation. This annotation allows for advanced text processing and transformation, making your code cleaner and more expressive.

## Overview

In this chapter, you will:

- Learn how to define and configure custom annotations.
- Discover how to use Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) to apply annotation rules.
- See practical examples of integrating the annotation with DTOs and services.

For a detailed walkthrough, check out the blog post [Introducing Custom Annotations: The Power of @StringProcessor in Spring Boot](https://dev.to/parthbt143/introducing-custom-annotations-the-power-of-stringprocessor-in-spring-boot-31e9).

## Project Files

- **Annotation**: `StringProcessor.java` - Defines the custom annotation.
- **Aspect**: `StringProcessorAspect.java` - Handles processing of annotated fields.
- **Controller**: `StringProcessorController.java` - Demonstrates the annotation in action.
- **DTO**: `UserDTO.java` - Shows usage of the annotation within a data transfer object.

Feel free to explore the code and follow along with the blog for a comprehensive guide!
